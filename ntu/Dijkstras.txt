Dijkstras(G, v): // Determine single source shortest path
    // v is the staring node
    for all vertices w:
        w.mark = false
        w.SP = inf

    v.SP = 0

    while there are unmarked vertices:
        w = GetUnmarkedVerticeWithMinSP()
        w.mark = true
        for all edges (w, z) where z.mark = false
            candidate = w.SP + length(w,z)
            if candidate < z.SP then
                z.SP = candidate
    // What is the result?
    // Answer: list of vertices w_i with each having the SP-length from v to w_i.
